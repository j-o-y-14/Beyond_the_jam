### Beyond the Jam: Worldwide Traffic Congestion Analysis

Uncovering patterns, causes, and solutions to global traffic congestion

### Overview

Beyond the Jam is a data-driven project analyzing global traffic congestion trends using visualization and insights. The study explores how population, vehicle ownership, road quality, and regional patterns affect congestion, and identifies the top causes and most/least congested countries worldwide.

###  Problem Statement

Traffic congestion is a persistent global issue that disrupts daily life, slows economic growth, and strains infrastructure. Despite investments in roads and vehicles, delays continue to rise in many countries due to increasing populations, urban density, and poor road quality.

INRIX (2024) reports that drivers in the most congested cities lose over 100 hours annually in traffic.
TomTom Traffic Index (2023) confirms similar global patterns, with congestion worsening in cities such as London, Paris, and New York.

### Research Objectives

Identify congestion patterns by time of day and weekday.

Compare congestion levels across countries and regions.

Assess the role of road quality and vehicle ownership.

Explore the effect of population on congestion.

Rank the most and least congested countries.

Normalize congestion metrics for fairer comparisons.

Analyze key causes of congestion.

Provide actionable recommendations.

### Tools Used

Excel → Data cleaning, preparation, merging.

Tableau → Data analysis and visualization (dashboards, charts).

Lovable → Interactive website for sharing insights.

GitHub → Project documentation and version control.

### Methodology

## 1.Data Collection

INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard (2024)

TomTom Traffic Index (2023)

World Bank Open Data

UN World Urbanization Prospects (2023)

Global Competitiveness Report (2019)

## 2.Data Cleaning & Preparation

Standardized country names, units, and fields.

Removed duplicates and missing values.

Created calculated fields (average delays, congestion per capita, etc.).

## 3.Data Analysis & Visualization

Imported cleaned datasets into Tableau.

Built line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, and dashboards.

Normalized metrics such as delay per 1,000 vehicles and per capita.

### Key Insights

Time of Day: Rush hour peaks occur in the morning (6–8 AM) and afternoon (3–5 PM).

Day of the Week: Tuesday–Friday have the worst congestion; Sundays are the lightest.

Population vs Congestion: High population countries (Asia, Europe) show longer delays; North America manages better with strong infrastructure.

Road Quality: Better infrastructure = lower delays; poorer regions see higher congestion.

Vehicle Ownership: More vehicles generally mean more congestion, but good infrastructure mitigates this.

Top 5 Congested Countries: Philippines, Romania, Taiwan, Mexico, Greece.

Top 5 Least Congested: South Africa, Australia, Norway, Brazil, Canada.

Top Causes of Congestion: High vehicle volume (40%), poor road infrastructure (20%), accidents (15%), inefficient traffic management (15%), weak public transport/urban sprawl (10%).

### Recommendations

Invest in public transportation and promote its usage.

Improve road infrastructure to handle higher traffic volumes.

Introduce traffic management systems (e.g., smart signals, congestion pricing).

Encourage carpooling, cycling, and walking in urban areas.

Develop policies targeting peak hour congestion (e.g., flexible work hours).
