 Beyond the Jam: Mode  and Road Type Dynamics of Nairobi Congestion
#1. Problem Statement

Traffic congestion in Nairobi is causing longer commute times, increased emissions, and lost productivity. The project seeks to quantify congestion patterns by time and location, identify peak hotspots, and offer data-driven insights for interventions.

#4. Stretch Goals (Advanced Enhancements)
Extra efforts for deeper insights:
•	 Predictive Modeling: Forecast congestion by hour/day using ARIMA, Prophet, or Tableau’s forecasting features.
•	 Multimodal Comparison: Include matatu/public transport vs private vehicle travel times.
•	 Real-time Dashboards: Set up live feeds with streaming or scheduled data refresh.
•	 Scenario Analysis: Model impacts of interventions like new BRT lanes or congestion pricing.
